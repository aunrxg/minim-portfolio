In today's world of remote communication, building your own **video conferencing app** is a great way to learn real-time web technologies. As part of my full-stack training, I created a **Zoom/Google Meet like platform** that enables users to create and join meetings, share audio/video in real time, and communicate seamlessly.

The main technology powering the live video and audio calls in this app is **WebRTC**, and in this article, we'll deep dive into **how I implemented the peer-to-peer connection layer**, with the help of a custom **signaling server built using Socket.io**.


## WebRTC

**WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication)** is a technology that enables browsers to establish **peer-to-peer (P2P)** connections for real-time video, audio, and data transfer — all without needing any plugins or third-party software.

But while WebRTC handles media transfer, it doesn't know how to find or connect users. That's where a signaling server comes in.

## Signaling Server

WebRTC requires peers to exchange certain metadata before they can establish a direct connection. This includes:

  - **SDP (Session Description Protocol)**: Describes the media configuration of each peer (codecs, formats, etc.)

  - **ICE Candidates**: Network information needed to traverse NAT/firewalls and make the connection work

Since browsers cannot exchange this information by themselves, we use a signaling server — a simple backend (in our case, powered by Socket.io) that helps two clients communicate this data before WebRTC takes over.

## The WebRTC Connection Flow

Let's go step-by-step through how I built the peer-to-peer connection system for the app.

### 1. Get Local Media 

```js
const stream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ video: true, audio: true });
localVideo.srcObject = stream;
```

### 2. Connect to Signaling Server (Socket.io)

Once the app loads, it connects to the Node.js + Socket.io signaling server:
```js
const socket = io('https://your-server.com');
socket.emit('join-room', roomId);
```
When a user joins a room, the server places them in a room (like a lobby), allowing them to find and communicate with other participants.

### 3. Create a WebRTC PeerConnection

We create a `RTCPeerConnection` with optional STUN servers to help find public IP addresses:

```js 
const peer = new RTCPeerConnection({
  iceServers: [{ urls: 'stun:stun.l.google.com:19302' }]
});
```
Then, we attach our local media tracks (video and audio):
```js 
localStream.getTracks().forEach(track => {
  peer.addTrack(track, localStream);
});
```

### 4. SDP Offer/Answer Exchange via Signaling

Now comes the **key step**: exchanging SDPs.

**Caller (Peer A)**

  Creates an SDP Offer -> Set it as Local Description -> Send it via Socket

```js 
const offer = await peer.createOffer();
await peer.setLocalDescription(offer);
socket.emit('offer', { offer, to: remoteUserId });
```

**Receiver (Peer B)**

  Recieves offer -> Set it as Remote Description -> Create an SDP Answer -> Set it as Local and Send back

  ```js 
    socket.on('offer', async ({ offer, from }) => {
    await peer.setRemoteDescription(new RTCSessionDescription(offer));
    const answer = await peer.createAnswer();
    await peer.setLocalDescription(answer);
    socket.emit('answer', { answer, to: from });
  });
  ```

**Caller receives the answer**:

```js 
socket.on('answer', async ({ answer }) => {
  await peer.setRemoteDescription(new RTCSessionDescription(answer));
});
```

This completes the initial handshake: both peers now know how to speak to each other.


### 5. ICE Candidate Exchange

Once the connection is starting to form, each peer gathers ICE candidates (network info) and sends them to the other peer via the signaling server:

```js 
peer.onicecandidate = (event) => {
  if (event.candidate) {
    socket.emit('ice-candidate', { candidate: event.candidate, to: remoteUserId });
  }
};
```

On receiving ICE candidates:
```js 
socket.on('ice-candidate', ({ candidate }) => {
  peer.addIceCandidate(new RTCIceCandidate(candidate));
});
```

These ICE candidates help the peers find the best possible route (direct or via NAT traversal) to communicate.


## Final Thoughts

Building this system taught me how real-time technologies work under the hood. WebRTC is incredibly powerful, but also requires you to understand network topology, browser limitations, and asynchronous signaling.

By combining WebRTC with Socket.io, I created a lightweight yet functional peer-to-peer video chat platform — something that can be extended into a full-fledged product with features like screen sharing, recording, and chat.

If you're looking to dive deeper into real-time web apps, building your own signaling and WebRTC-based system is one of the best projects you can try.

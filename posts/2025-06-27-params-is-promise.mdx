The Most Frustrating TypeScript Error I Solved in Next.js 15 — and What You Need to Know. 

## The Background

> I was building blog and project feature for my portfolio in Next.js App router using @next/mdx, and everything worked locally… until I tried deploying to Vercel. Suddenly, I hit this frustrating error:

```
Type '{ slug: string; }' is missing the following properties from type 'Promise<any>': then, catch, finally, [Symbol.toStringTag]
```

---

## My Initial Setup 

### My File: `app/posts/[slug]/page.tsx`

```tsx
export default async function PostPage({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) {
  const slug = params.slug;
}
```

### My `generateStaticParams()` looked like:

```tsx
export async function generateStaticParams(): Promise<{ slug: string }[]> {
  return await getAllPostPaths(true);
}
```

this function `getAllPostPaths` return an array with slugs something like this: 
```
[
  { slug: "slug-blog-1" },
  { slug: "slug-blog-2" },
]
```
and it was intended to return this.

## Elephant in the room

Even though everything looked right, TypeScript said:

```
Type '{ slug: string; }' is missing the following properties from type 'Promise<any>'
```

## What I tried (That didn't worked)

- Explicitly typing generateStaticParams

- Defining a clean PageProps type

- Clearing .next/, node_modules/, and lock files

- Commenting out real logic

- Rebuilding clean

- Pushing to Vercel again and again

Still, the error persisted.

## The Real Problem: Next.js 15 Changes `params` to a Promise

After hours of debugging, I discovered that in **Next.js 15**, route segment props like `params` are now passed in as a **Promise**, not a plain object.

See the official [Next.js RFC & GitHub issue](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/80494):

> “The params and searchParams values passed to your route handlers are now Promises to support streaming and async composition.”


## The fix

Update your component to **await** the `params`:

```tsx
export default async function PostPage({
  params,
}: {
  params: Promise<{ slug: string }>;
}) {
  const { slug } = await params;

  // Now works fine!
}
```

Boom. The error disappears — both locally and on Vercel.

## Final Thoughts

This was hands down one of the most frustrating bugs I’ve solved — not because it was complicated, but because it was undocumented and subtle. The lesson?

> Sometimes the framework changes, and it's not your fault. But debugging it will grow you more than any tutorial ever will.

## Edit

Got a reply from the **Tech Lead of Next.js and turbopack** himself, appreciate his efforts to response himself. Thanks a lot Tim.

Here is the [official documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/upgrading/version-15#params--searchparams) for asynchronous layout with params and searchParams

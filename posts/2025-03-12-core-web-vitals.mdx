During my internship at Saral Startup School, I worked on their production website built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS. One of the key challenges I faced — and learned the most from — was improving the site's Core Web Vitals: LCP (Largest Contentful Paint), CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift), and INP (Interaction to Next Paint).

In this blog, I'll walk you through how I approached this problem, the tools I used, the fixes I applied, and the final results we achieved. If you're a developer working with Next.js or any frontend-heavy site, this might help you avoid some common pitfalls!

## Why Core Web Vitals Matter
Core Web Vitals are a set of performance signals that measure real-world user experience. They play a major role in SEO, page speed, and overall usability.

The three key metrics:

- LCP (Largest Contentful Paint): Measures how long it takes the largest element (often a hero image or heading) to load.

- CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift): Measures unexpected layout movements during page load.

- INP (Interaction to Next Paint): Measures responsiveness during user interaction.

When I joined Saral Startup School as a Web Developer Intern, one of my early tasks was to improve the performance and SEO of the landing page. The initial web vitals scores weren't horrible — but definitely not good enough for a great user experience.

## Initial Metrics (Before Optimization)
We used PageSpeed Insights and Chrome Lighthouse for auditing. Here's what the initial scores looked like:

{/* | Metric | Value (Mobile) |	      Status        |
| ------ | -------------- | ------------------- |
| LCP	   |    4.5s        |   Needs Improvement |
| CLS	   |    0.23s       |   Needs Improvement |
| INP	   |    380ms	      |   Poor              | */}

These were dragging down the site's performance grade, and the experience on slower devices felt clunky and sluggish.

##  The Audit Process
To start, I:

- Ran Lighthouse audits on all key pages.

- Installed the Web Vitals Chrome extension to track metrics in real-time.

- Identified blocking scripts, unoptimized images, layout shifts, and unnecessary re-renders.

- Inspected large components in DevTools and studied the React profiler for sluggish state updates.

Here's what I found:

- LCP was delayed due to large images and unused render-blocking CSS.

- CLS came from images and embeds without width/height attributes and dynamic sections like banners loading late.

- INP was caused by large JS bundles and some components triggering heavy re-renders on input.

## Fixes I Implemented
### Fixing LCP
- Replaced `<img>` tags with Next.js `Image` component with `priority={true}` for the hero banner.

- Used optimized image formats `(webp)` and served from Vercel CDN.

- Removed unused CSS via Tailwind's purge feature.

- Deprioritized third-party fonts and loaded critical fonts inline.

### Fixing CLS
- Explicitly defined `width` and `height` attributes on all images and iframes.

- Reserved space for components that load async (like newsletter banners).

- Applied `font-display: swap` to Google Fonts to prevent layout jank.

- Delayed the loading of non-critical UI elements like animations.

### Fixing INP
- Code-splitting: Used `React.lazy()` and dynamic imports for large components.

- Debounced input fields that triggered expensive state updates.

- Reduced unnecessary DOM updates in dropdowns, menus, and modals.

- Removed unused JavaScript and replaced bulky dependencies with lighter alternatives.

## Final Results (After Optimization)
After pushing these fixes, here's what our updated metrics looked like on the same page:

{/* | Metric | Value (Mobile) |	      Status        |
| ------ | -------------- | ------------------- |
| LCP	   |     1.9s       |        Good         |
| CLS	   |     0.03s      |        Good         |
| INP	   |     145ms	    |        Good         | */}

The performance score on Lighthouse jumped from 68 → 92, and users on lower-end devices reported smoother interactions. Page load felt significantly faster, and even Google Search Console reflected improved Core Web Vitals coverage.

## What I Learned
- Optimizing performance is not about hacks — it's about understanding the browser render pipeline.

- Fixing layout shifts is often as simple as being explicit with sizes and spacing.

- Even small refactors like lazy-loading non-essential components can make a huge difference.

- Debugging performance is like detective work — tools like Lighthouse, WebPageTest, and React Profiler are your best friends.

- Some other key optimization includes: 
  - Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
  - Static Side Generation (SSG)
  - Image Optimization
  - Prefetching Routes

And above all, I realized that measuring is just as important as building. You can't improve what you don't track.

## Final Thoughts
If you're working on a production website, especially with a framework like Next.js, you need to think about performance from day one. Core Web Vitals aren't just for SEO — they define how your product feels.

During my time at Saral Startup School, this task helped me grow immensely as a frontend developer, and I'm proud to say I shipped a faster, more usable product.
